> Review: Taking place in a farm in the middle of nowhere, we meet a family who is trying to settle into their new home. When all of a sudden, a meteor crashes in their front yard and emits a color that can only be described as new. Weird events unfold as the meteor begins to affect each family member. If you enjoy H.P. Lovecraft type of horror, then this movie is for you with its great visuals, minimal jumpscares, and it is a good choice for those wanting to try a modern cosmic movie.

> Rating: 8.5/10
