> Review: Taking place in Tokyo, Japan. Pulse is a relentlessly depressive film from beginning to end. It depicts the main characters discovering spirits are trying to communicate with the real world through the internet. Each main character experiences their own depressive downfall as they try to figure out what the ghosts are trying to tell them. This film, though depressing, does a great job at keeping each character's plot unique and intriguing, it was creative for the time it was released at and is still a movie worth watching.

> Rating: 9.5/10
