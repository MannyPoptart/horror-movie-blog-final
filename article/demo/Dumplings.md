> Review: In Dumplings, we meet Mrs. Li who is a wealthy actress worried about losing her youthful appearance. She makes an effort to privately meet Aunt Mei who is a local chef that makes dumplings which supposedly maintain a person's youth. As Mrs. Li continues to eat the dumplings, she becomes more and more curious as to what exactly Aunt Mei is using for the filling. This film is great because it does not use cheap jumpscares and does not hold back on its horrific reveals as the story progresses. 

> Rating: 8.5/10
